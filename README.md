# Web-Map-Python
 Simple Web Map in Python using Folium, showing places to visit/visited. Markers can be entered, deleted and changed from the unvisited to visited by either editing a txt file or through the additional console program (main.py). All the attached files must be in the same directory for the program to work properly.
